Description: Empirical Bayes methods for learning prior distributions from data.
    An unknown prior distribution (g) has yielded (unobservable) parameters, each of
    which produces a data point from a parametric exponential family (f). The goal
    is to estimate the unknown prior ("g-modeling") by deconvolution and Empirical
    Bayes methods.
