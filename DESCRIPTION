Description: Empirical Bayes methods for learning prior distributions from data.
    An unknown prior distribution (g) has yielded (unobservable) parameters, each of
    which produces a data point from a parametric exponential family (f). The goal
    is to estimate the unknown prior ("g-modeling") by deconvolution and Empirical
    Bayes methods. Details and examples are in the paper by Narasimhan and Efron
    (2020, <doi:10.18637/jss.v094.i11>).
